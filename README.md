# Artificial Intelligence in Test Automation

In its simplest form, artificial intelligence combines computer science with big datasets 
to aid in problem-solving. The three main categories of AI are:

1- Artificial Narrow Intelligence, or ANI, is a subset of weak artificial intelligence that has been 
programmed to carry out particular tasks. Today, ANI dominates AI because of its focused emphasis on a 
single topic.

2- AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) is a type of powerful AI that is still considered 
hypothetical.Although AGI has not yet been developed, it is anticipated that it will be a computer with 
intelligence comparable to humans in terms of problem-solving, learning, and other areas.

3- ASI (Artificial Super Intelligence) â€“ We have only been able to get glimpses of what such an AI may 
look like in sci-fi movies. ASI is another, as of now, theoretical AI. This is a form of AI that would 
supersede human ability and intelligence.
