# Artificial Intelligence in Test Automation

What comes to mind when you hear the term "artificial intelligence" (AI)?
Perhaps sophisticated humanoid robots or sci-fi movie-era technologies come 
to mind. However, it turns out that this supposedly future technology is now
a part of our daily existence. It is present in our houses, televisions, and 
cell phones to make daily activities easier. In order to improve the efficiency
of your software testing efforts, AI can be incorporated. While "AI in testing" 
is a trendy term that might raise some doubt, it can actually add value and
streamline your testing processes.

Artificial intelligence is a system that can support human cognition and activities. 
It has increasingly self-learning capabilities. By comprehending the environment, resolving 
human issues, and carrying out human tasks, it achieves this.

## Categories of AI
In its simplest form, artificial intelligence combines computer science with big datasets 
to aid in problem-solving. The three main categories of AI are:

1- Artificial Narrow Intelligence, or ANI, is a subset of weak artificial intelligence that has been 
programmed to carry out particular tasks. Today, ANI dominates AI because of its focused emphasis on a 
single topic.

2- AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) is a type of powerful AI that is still considered 
hypothetical.Although AGI has not yet been developed, it is anticipated that it will be a computer with 
intelligence comparable to humans in terms of problem-solving, learning, and other areas.

3- "ASI" stands for "Artificial Super Intelligence." Only in sci-fi movies have we been able to catch a
peek of what such an AI may resemble. Another theorised AI at the moment is ASI. This kind of artificial 
intelligence would surpass human capacity and intelligence. 

## How AI Can Optimize Your Testing

The last couple decades have seen a fast evolution in software testing. Manual testing was the first step,
followed by early automation, agile testing, and finally continuous testing. It has now reached the testing 
phase for AI-augmented autonomy.

Although it may seem unachievable, you may begin integrating AI capabilities that will provide the groundwork 
for autonomous testing. By accelerating test creation, increasing test coverage, and lowering test maintenance,
AI can improve your testing.

Intelligent design uses object recognition to automatically identify new items and make modifications to the DOM.
Additionally, there is framework generation, which analyses your application automatically and suggests a test framework.

One form of intelligent test execution is business process automation, which aids in automating business activities
for end-to-end testing. The last type of intelligent test maintenance is self-healing, which automatically refreshes
your test suite as your application develops or progresses.

## The difference between AI, ML, and DL

Artificial intelligence: Ability of a machine to develop its own intelligence.

Machine learning: Ability of a machine to use algorithms by which it can automatically learn from data and experience.

Deep learning: Ability of a machine to learn via algorithms which mimic the human brain.

## AI in Automation Testing

Applications of AI in Intelligent Test Automation in General:

1- Tests create a tonne of data, which must be sorted through in order to extract meaning from AI analytics of test
automation data. This procedure' efficiency is significantly increased with the use of AI. Errors may be found and 
categorised using AI algorithms. False negatives and true positives in test cases can also be found using more advanced
AI algorithm applications. This can be extremely beneficial and significantly lessen the workload for QAs.

2- Self-healing tests: Conventional test automation tools specify the components of an application using specific IDs.
These elements are also subject to change if the programme is updated or altered in any manner. The tests that were working
well before the modification will now fail and produce a false negative result because of the fixed definitions that have 
been assigned to these items. Artificial intelligence algorithms are used in self-healing tests to automatically detect 
unanticipated problems caused by dynamic characteristics and suggest a better solution or automatically update the script.
This type of testing not only prevents tests from failing but also saves QAs time from having to search for and resolve issues.

3- Visual Locators: In AI-based user interface testing, visual locators may now locate components on a web application by vision,
even if their locators have been changed. As a result, there is no longer a requirement for hard coding using locators such 
accessibility IDs. Additionally, OCR and other image recognition methods may now be used by intelligent automation systems to 
visually map the programme, find visual regressions, or check items.

## The Evolution of AI
The potential applications of artificial intelligence are limitless, and each year, the usage of AI algorithms for intelligent 
test automation becomes more complex. Therefore, it is evident that there is significant potential for AI to alter the future 
of software testing, even though many AI test automation solutions are still in their infancy.

Users of BrowserStack may automate testing across more than 3000 different hardware, browser, and operating system combinations.
Users of Browserstack can run automated tests using a variety of languages and frameworks to test AI programmes like chatbots.
