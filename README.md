# Artificial Intelligence in Test Automation

What comes to mind when you hear the term "artificial intelligence" (AI)?
Perhaps sophisticated humanoid robots or sci-fi movie-era technologies come 
to mind. However, it turns out that this supposedly future technology is now
a part of our daily existence. It is present in our houses, televisions, and 
cell phones to make daily activities easier. In order to improve the efficiency
of your software testing efforts, AI can be incorporated. While "AI in testing" 
is a trendy term that might raise some doubt, it can actually add value and
streamline your testing processes.

Artificial intelligence is a system that can support human cognition and activities. 
It has increasingly self-learning capabilities. By comprehending the environment, resolving 
human issues, and carrying out human tasks, it achieves this.

## Categories of AI
In its simplest form, artificial intelligence combines computer science with big datasets 
to aid in problem-solving. The three main categories of AI are:

1- Artificial Narrow Intelligence, or ANI, is a subset of weak artificial intelligence that has been 
programmed to carry out particular tasks. Today, ANI dominates AI because of its focused emphasis on a 
single topic.

2- AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) is a type of powerful AI that is still considered 
hypothetical.Although AGI has not yet been developed, it is anticipated that it will be a computer with 
intelligence comparable to humans in terms of problem-solving, learning, and other areas.

3- "ASI" stands for "Artificial Super Intelligence." Only in sci-fi movies have we been able to catch a
peek of what such an AI may resemble. Another theorised AI at the moment is ASI. This kind of artificial 
intelligence would surpass human capacity and intelligence. 

## How AI Can Optimize Your Testing

The last couple decades have seen a fast evolution in software testing. Manual testing was the first step,
followed by early automation, agile testing, and finally continuous testing. It has now reached the testing 
phase for AI-augmented autonomy.

Although it may seem unachievable, you may begin integrating AI capabilities that will provide the groundwork 
for autonomous testing. By accelerating test creation, increasing test coverage, and lowering test maintenance,
AI can improve your testing.

Intelligent design uses object recognition to automatically identify new items and make modifications to the DOM.
Additionally, there is framework generation, which analyses your application automatically and suggests a test framework.

One form of intelligent test execution is business process automation, which aids in automating business activities
for end-to-end testing. The last type of intelligent test maintenance is self-healing, which automatically refreshes
your test suite as your application develops or progresses.

## The difference between AI, ML, and DL

Artificial intelligence: Ability of a machine to develop its own intelligence.

Machine learning: Ability of a machine to use algorithms by which it can automatically learn from data and experience.

Deep learning: Ability of a machine to learn via algorithms which mimic the human brain.

## AI in Automation Testing

Applications of AI in Intelligent Test Automation in General:

1- Tests create a tonne of data, which must be sorted through in order to extract meaning from AI analytics of test
automation data. This procedure' efficiency is significantly increased with the use of AI. Errors may be found and 
categorised using AI algorithms. False negatives and true positives in test cases can also be found using more advanced
AI algorithm applications. This can be extremely beneficial and significantly lessen the workload for QAs.

2- Self-healing tests: Conventional test automation tools specify the components of an application using specific IDs.
These elements are also subject to change if the programme is updated or altered in any manner. The tests that were working
well before the modification will now fail and produce a false negative result because of the fixed definitions that have 
been assigned to these items. Artificial intelligence algorithms are used in self-healing tests to automatically detect 
unanticipated problems caused by dynamic characteristics and suggest a better solution or automatically update the script.
This type of testing not only prevents tests from failing but also saves QAs time from having to search for and resolve issues.

3- Visual Locators: In AI-based user interface testing, visual locators may now locate components on a web application by vision,
even if their locators have been changed. As a result, there is no longer a requirement for hard coding using locators such 
accessibility IDs. Additionally, OCR and other image recognition methods may now be used by intelligent automation systems to 
visually map the programme, find visual regressions, or check items.

## The Evolution of AI
The potential applications of artificial intelligence are limitless, and each year, the usage of AI algorithms for intelligent 
test automation becomes more complex. Therefore, it is evident that there is significant potential for AI to alter the future 
of software testing, even though many AI test automation solutions are still in their infancy.

# Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence for Test Automation
Machine learning is creating a strong impact on software testing. The process of a software tester is either manual or automated. Manual testers find it difficult to work on the same process and review documents constantly. Many testers and QA teams are incorporating test automation in their companies. Machine learning is benefitting manual testers by simplifying their tasks. This helps companies produce higher quality and quantity of work in a shorter time.Hence, it is important for manual testers to learn automation testing. This method of testing helps save time and money. It also helps increase test coverage, improve the accuracy, and morale of the QA team. Through automation testing, developers and testers get the opportunity to work as a team. In short, automation does the job better than manual testing.However, there are certain things to consider in test automation while applying artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning.
## 6 Things to Consider When Applying Machine Learning & AI in Test Automation
1. **UI Testing:** Visual testing is a quality assurance activity of software developers. They evaluate whether the application appears and performs the way it was intended for the end-user. It is important to know the kinds of patterns machine learning can recognize. Hence, a traditional machine vision system may require a serious inspection while reading complex surface textures and image quality. Therefore, A deep learning tool or system is, therefore, better suited for visual inspection of web or mobile applications. It provides rapid and accurate results.
2. **API Testing:** API testing is a type of software testing that enables communication and data exchange between two software systems.While testing at the API level, you need a higher degree of technical expertise and tools to get comprehensive test coverage.Therefore, it is important to consider whether testers have intimate knowledge of different application interfaces.Through AI, you can convert manual UI tests into automated API tests which take care of all the heavy lifting work
3. **Domain Knowledge:** Having domain expertise is crucial in software testing. Whether it is manual or automated testing, with artificial intelligence you can test the applications better. For example, writing test scripts in codes using Java, Python, C# can be challenging. In automated testing, advanced tools help testers develop codes and test scripts. With AI, machines can write flawless codes themselves
4. **Spidering AI:** The most popular approach to writing test scripts in test automation is done through spidering. It has a feature through which you can point at your web application using AI/ML tools. It then begins to crawl over the application automatically by scanning and collecting data.Over time, the tools build a dataset and create patterns for your application while running tests. The next time when you run this tool, it points out potential issues by taking references from its dataset containing patterns and behavior. However, keep in mind that some of the differences might not be valid. In this case, an expert with domain knowledge will have to confirm whether the issue flagged by ML is a bug or not. Spidering AI will be helpful in understanding which parts of an application should be tested. To put it simply, machine learning will carry out heavy tasks and a tester will have to validate the accuracy of the results.
5. **Test Script:** Software testers will find it difficult to determine the number of tests required when a code has been altered. The automated testing tools based on artificial intelligence predict whether an application requires multiple tests or not. 
There are two benefits of running tests using AI. You can stop running tests unnecessarily and save more time. It is convenient to analyze the overall performance of a system without repeating the test scripts. Hence, you do not have to monitor it every time manually.
6. **Robotic Test Automation:** Robotic process automation (RPA) refers to a software that performs repetitive business processes without any human interaction.It helps in automating existing interfaces in IT systems and maintains them completely. RPA scans the screen, navigates the systems, and later identifies and gathers data.The tasks are performed solely by the bots and the tests can be done using the web, desktop, or mobile applications. It helps set up test data and run regression tests. The main advantages of RPA are: scalability, codeless testing, cost savings, increased productivity, accurate results and flexibility
#### Final Words:
Almost half of the test procedures can be automated using artificial intelligence. Testers can make use of machine learning to teach systems to detect errors that may go undetected using manual testing. By using AI in your test automation, you can achieve accurate results in a shorter time. You can save time as AI takes care of most of the test process.However, you must understand the business process, test scenarios, test scripts, and how to run the tests using artificial intelligence.

# DeepChecks
DeepChecks is the leading tool for testing and for validating your machine learning models and data, and it enables doing so with minimal effort. Deepchecks accompanies you through various validation and testing needs such as verifying your data’s integrity, inspecting its distributions, validating data splits, evaluating your model and comparing between different models.

## When Should you use Deepchecks?
Deepchecks has many built-in checks and suites that can help validating various points throughout the research phase. Of course, every research process has its unique steps and challenges, and therefore all checks and suites can easily customized. Alongside that, we have identified that there are several recurring scenarios, that each have their own needs and characteristics.

## Which Type of Checks Exits?
They are checks for different phases in the ML workflow:
1. Data Integrity
2. Train-Test Validation (Distribution, Drift and Methodology Checks)
3. Model Performance Evaluation
## Checks:
Each check enables you to inspect a specific aspect of your data and models. They are the basic building block of the deepchecks package, covering all kinds of common issues, such as:
1. Weak Segments Performance
2. Train Test Feature Drift
3. Date Train Test Leakage Overlap
4. Conflicting Labels
Each check can have two types of results:

1. A visual result meant for display (e.g. a figure or a table).
2. A return value that can be used for validating the expected check results

## How does it Work ? 
Deepchecks is built of checks, each designated to help to identify a specific issue. Some checks relate only to the data and labels and some require also the model. Suites are composed of checks. A Suite runs a collection of Checks with optional Conditions added to them. Each check contains outputs to display in a notebook and/or conditions with a pass/fail/warning output.
## What Do You Need in Order to Start?
Depending on your phase and what you wish to validate, you’ll need a subset of the following:
1. Raw data (before pre-processing such as OHE, string processing, etc.), with optional labels
2. The model’s training data with labels
3. Test data (which the model isn’t exposed to) with labels
4. A supported model that you wish to validate, including: scikit-learn, XGBoost, PyTorch, and more.
